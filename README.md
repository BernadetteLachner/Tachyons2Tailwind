# ðŸŒªTachyons2Tailwind



The fact that Tailwind overtook Tachyons about a year+ ago in npm trends, that it's in active development and that it supports a broader set of media queries, means that maybe it is time switch from Tachyons to Tailwind?

This is a repository dedicated to making the transition from <b>Tachyons2Tailwind</b> a breeze! ðŸ•¶

Requires Node and some old Tachyons for target practice.

<h3>Important information</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Tachyons and Tailwind use different media queries (px vs em).</li>
  <li>In each framework, some elements have been styled directly. These elements will change accordingly, even without assigned classes. (This is particularly noteworthy when it comes to images.)</li>
  <li>A cool <a href="https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet">Tailwind Cheatsheet</a></li>
  <li>Use can use <code>https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss/dist/tailwind.min.css</code> in your header until Tailwind has been configured. Makes testing this much easier!</li>
</ul>
