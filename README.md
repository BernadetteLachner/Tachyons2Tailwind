# ðŸŒªTachyons2Tailwind



The fact that Tailwind overtook Tachyons about a year+ ago in npm trends, that it's in active development and that it supports a broader set of media queries, means that maybe it is time switch from Tachyons to Tailwind?

This is a repository dedicated to making the transition from <b>Tachyons2Tailwind</b> a breeze! ðŸ•¶
